# Due Firmware


## Note

Please ensure that you use Arduino IDE version 1.6.5 (v1.6.6 & 1.6.7 currently have issues with symlinked libraries which is a problem)

Also please ensure you use Due Library version 1.6.4 as 1.6.5 and 1.6.6 have issues.

Later versions of both of these may resolve the issues, but revert back to the above reasons if you encounter problems.
